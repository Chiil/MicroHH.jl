# MicroHH

This is a Julia port of the dynamical core of [MicroHH](https://microhh.org), a 3D CFD code to simulate the atmospheric boundary layer. It is made for educational and exploratory research purposes, including machine learning. In comparison to its C++/CUDA reference it lacks all physical parameterizations, but it comes with the ability to run multiple simulations at the same time and let them interact.

A few example cases are in the `cases` folder.
