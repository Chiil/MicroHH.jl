# use H.264 compression to create very high quality and small file size movies 
# framerate is the fps of the movie
# r is the number of frames per second in the output, leading to duplicates in case framerate < r

# ONE PASS FILTERING (aim for constant quality)
# crf is quality (0 is lossless, 15 is very good, 23 is standard)
